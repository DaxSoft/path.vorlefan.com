# Stream

```ts
new PathRoute().stream();
```

This class helps you to write and read files using the Node's Stream function.

## .read

This function reads a file asynchronously using `fs.createReadStream` and returns the content as an string.
If the file cannot be read, the function returns undefined.

**Paramaters**

-   `{String} filepath`: the filepath of the file to be read
-   `{(chunk:string|Buffer,data:string|Buffer): void|undefined} onData`: callback function that interacts with each chunk of the file

**Return Values**

-   `{undefined}`: reading fails
-   `{String}`: if reading is success

```ts
const route = new PathRoute();
const content = await route.stream().read(filepath);
```

## .write

This function writes a file asynchronously using `fs.createWriteStream` and returns the content as an boolean, indicating
if the file has been written with success or not.

**Paramaters**

-   `{String} filepath`: the filepath of the json file
-   `{String} data`: the data to be saved

**Return Values**

-   `{boolean}`: true is success, othewrise is failure

```ts
const route = new PathRoute();
const content = await route.stream().write(filepath, { x: 1, y: 2 });
```
