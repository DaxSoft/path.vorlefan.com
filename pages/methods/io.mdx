# File

```ts
new PathRoute().io();
```

This class helps you with functions to handle files, be it writing, copying, deleting and so on.

## .isFileValid

This function reads a file asynchronously and returns the content as an boolean, verifying
if the file is accessible or not.

**Paramaters**

-   `{String} filepath`: the filepath of the json file
-   `{['R_OK', 'F_OK', 'W_OK']} modes =  ['R_OK', 'F_OK']`: the constants that will be used to verify the file, check out [here](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v10.x/docs/api/fs.html#fs_fspromises_access_path_mode)

**Return Values**

-   `{boolean}`: true is okay, otherwise is failure

```ts
const route = new PathRoute();
const isFileValid = await route.io().isFileValid(filepeath);
```

## .copy

This function reads a file asynchronously and copy into a new file

**Paramaters**

-   `{String} sourceFilepath`: the origin filepath of the file to be cloned
-   `{String} targetFilepath`: the destination of the new file

**Return Values**

-   `{boolean}`: true is okay, otherwise is failure

```ts
const route = new PathRoute();
const hasCloned = await route.io().copy(source, destination);
```

## .read

This function reads a file asynchronously and returns it contents as a string.
If the file cannot be read, the function returns undefined.

**Paramaters**

-   `{String} filepath`: the filepath of the file to be read
-   `{BufferEncoding} encoding = utf-8`: the encoding

**Return Values**

-   `{string}`: if the reading is success
-   `{undefined}`: if the reading is a failure

```ts
const route = new PathRoute();
const content = await route.io().read(filepath);
```

## .write

This function writes a file asynchronously and returns a boolean.
If the file cannot be read, the function returns false.

**Paramaters**

-   `{String} filepath`: the filepath of the file to be read
-   `{string} data`: data to be saved
-   `{BufferEncoding} encoding = utf-8`: the encoding
-   `{boolean} force = true`: forces the file to be written even if it already exists

**Return Values**

-   `{boolean}`: true is success, othewrise is failure

```ts
const route = new PathRoute();
const content = await route.io().write(filepath, 'teste');
```

## .remove

This function removes a file asynchronously and returns a boolean.
If the file cannot be read, the function returns false.

**Paramaters**

-   `{String} filepath`: the filepath of the file to be removed

**Return Values**

-   `{boolean}`: true is success, othewrise is failure

```ts
const route = new PathRoute();
const removed = await route.io().remove(filepath);
```

## .isFolderValid

This function reads a folder and returns the content as an boolean, verifying
if the folder is valid or not.

**Paramaters**

-   `{String} folderpath`: the folder path

**Return Values**

-   `{boolean}`: true is okay, otherwise is failure

```ts
const route = new PathRoute();
const isFolderValid = await route.io().isFolderValid(filepeath);
```

## .createFolder

This function creates a folder and returns the content as an boolean, verifying
if the folder has been created or not

**Paramaters**

-   `{String} folderpath`: the folder path

**Return Values**

-   `{boolean}`: true is okay, otherwise is failure

```ts
const route = new PathRoute();
const createFolder = await route.io().createFolder(filepeath);
```

## .removeFolder

This function removes a folder and returns a boolean.
If the folder cannot be removed, the function returns false.

**Paramaters**

-   `{String} folderpath`: the folder path of the file to be removed

**Return Values**

-   `{boolean}`: true is success, othewrise is failure

```ts
const route = new PathRoute();
const removed = await route.io().removeFolder(filepath);
```

## .exists

This function checks if a folder or file exists and returns the content as an boolean, verifying
if it is valid or not.

**Paramaters**

-   `{String} filepath`: the path

**Return Values**

-   `{boolean}`: true is okay, otherwise is failure

```ts
const route = new PathRoute();
const exists = await route.io().exists(filepeath);
```

## .isDirectory

This function checks if a path is directory or not and returns the content as an boolean, verifying
if it is valid or not.

**Paramaters**

-   `{String} folderpath`: the path

**Return Values**

-   `{boolean}`: true is okay, otherwise is failure

```ts
const route = new PathRoute();
const folderpath = await route.io().isDirectory(filepeath);
```
