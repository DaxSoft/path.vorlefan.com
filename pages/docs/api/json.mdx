# JSON

```ts
new PathRoute().json();
```

This class helps you with functions to handle json files, such as to read and to write.

## .read

This function reads a JSON file asynchronously and returns the content as an object.
If the file cannot be read, the function returns undefined.
The return type of the function can be specified using the `#.read<T>` syntax,
where `T` is the desired type of the returned object. By default, the return type is
`Record<string, any>`, which allows the returned object to have any properties.

**Paramaters**

-   `{String} filepath`: the filepath of the json file

**Return Values**

-   `{undefined}`: reading fails
-   `{<T = Record<string, any>>}`: by default the type is `Record<string, any>`

```ts
const route = new PathRoute();
const content = await route.json().read<Array[]>(filepath);
```

## .write

This function writes a JSON file asynchronously and returns the content as an boolean, indicating
if the file has been written with success or not.

**Paramaters**

-   `{String} filepath`: the filepath of the json file
-   `{any} data`: the data to be saved using `JSON.stringify`
-   `{boolean} force = true`: forces the file to be written even if it already exists

**Return Values**

-   `{boolean}`: true is success, othewrise is failure

```ts
const route = new PathRoute();
await route.json().write(filepath, { x: 1, y: 2 });
```
