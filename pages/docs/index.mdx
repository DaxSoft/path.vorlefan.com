# PathRoute

This npm package gives you the ability to easily access and manage the file paths of your project.
Our core function is to provide a simple and intuitive way to navigate the folders and files within
your project, making it easier to organize and maintain your codebase.
Whether you're working on a small project or a large-scale application,
this package can save you time and hassle by streamlining your file management workflow.
Try it out and see how it can benefit your development process.

## Installation

Inside your Node project directory, run the following:

`shell
yarn add @vorlefan/path
`

## Quick Start

It is recommended that you create a new file at the source folder of your project where your code
is located, be it 'src' or whatever.

Example, create a new file named: `src/path.ts`

```ts
import { PathRoute } from '@vorlefan/path';

// creates a default pathRoute
const ProjectRoute = new PathRoute();
ProjectRoute.add('root', __dirname);

export { ProjectRoute };
```

Now you can start to interact over your folder and files from the project, example:

```ts
// creates a new folder named the version of your package.json and creates a new file named the name from
// package.json and fills with the current Date

const packageJson = await ProjectRoute.json().read(
    ProjectRoute.plug('root', 'package.json') || ''
);
if (packageJson) {
    const name = packageJson.name.replace(/@|\//gm, '_');
    await ProjectRoute.inject('packageJsonVersion', 'root', packageJson.version)
        .io()
        .write(
            ProjectRoute.plug('packageJsonVersion', name) || '',
            new Date().toDateString(),
            true
        );
}
```
