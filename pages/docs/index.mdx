## Introduction

This website is related to the [FrontendMasters workshop on JavaScript Patterns](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/tour-js-patterns/), which is split up into four parts:

The content is based on [Patterns.dev](https://www.patterns.dev) - a free online resource on design patterns and component patterns for building powerful web apps with vanilla JavaScript and React.

The patterns covered on this website and in the workshop can guide you when facing a problem other developers have encountered many times before, but are not a blunt tool for jamming into every scenario. The goal is to raise awareness to certain patterns, the problems they solve, and their implementation.
